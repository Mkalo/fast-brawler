# Fast Brawler

A TERA Toolbox module that works with your favourite skill predictor.
(Optimized for NextGen SP, but also works with PSP or Ping Remover)

RealTime Block™ is a completely new feature that makes brawler block much faster by ignoring the client press input and using my own code to detect button/mouse press, by doing this, you get much more responsive block and the possibility to perfectly queue block after skills without canceling it early with RealTime Block Queue™
